# TSP_OpenTour_OP
I do long distance motorcycle rallies.  Finding the best route from a list of GPS coordinates with point values FAST is part of the game.  This script takes the list of gps coords and pitches out to Google Maps API to make a Distance_Matrix.  Then this DM is run through Google ORTools to find a series of routes.
